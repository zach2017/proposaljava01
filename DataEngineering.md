# RfpData (requirements & evaluation criteria)
Here’s a practical, bullet-point playbook for how a **data engineer** collects, cleans, links, and serves info from **Excel/Sheets, resumes, business databases, and knowledge tools** so you can answer a complex **app-modernization RFP** (ReactJS + Java Spring, AWS, secure login, real-time + analytics) fast and accurately.

---

## Data Engineer Goal & Flow (at a glance)

* **Goal:** Turn scattered info (spreadsheets, resumes, DBs) into **clean, linked records** that a proposal generator can query.
* **Flow:** *Intake → Normalize → Link → Evaluate → Publish → Govern*.

---

# Step-by-step plan

## 1) Kickoff & inventory (what exists, who owns it)

* List sources: **Excel/Sheets**, **resumes (PDF/DOCX)**, **HR/ATS**, **CRM**, **project systems** (Jira/Confluence/Git), **certification portals**, **financials**, **partner lists**.
* Identify owners & refresh cadence; log access paths and permissions.

## 2) Access & raw capture

* Create read-only connections:

  * **Excel/Sheets:** export to CSV; lock a **/intake/raw** drop (dated filenames).
  * **Resumes:** collect originals; store in **/raw/resumes**; keep hash to avoid duplicates.
  * **Databases (HR/ATS/CRM/PMO):** read replicas or views; never pull PII you don’t need.
* Record metadata: source, contact, refresh frequency, last\_updated.

## 3) Define canonical schemas (what “good” looks like)

* **RfpData:** id, buyer, due\_date, requirement\_id, eval\_criteria\_id, constraints.
* **Requirements:** id, text, priority(must/should/could), weight, domain (UI/Auth/Streaming/Analytics/AWS).
* **Employee:** id, name, role, location, clearance, availability\_start, rate\_band.
* **EmployeeSkill:** employee\_id, skill (React, Spring, Kafka, Cognito/Keycloak, Redshift), proficiency(1–5), last\_used.
* **Certification:** name, issuer, level, **expires\_on**, verification\_url.
* **ProjectExperience:** id, title, industry, summary, **metrics(before/after, unit, period)**, tech\_stack, evidence\_urls, reference\_contact.
* **CompanyCapabilities:** capability, maturity, proof (partner tier, audit).
* **Partner:** name, capabilities, rates, NDA status.
* **Template bindings:** section\_id → source query.

## 4) Create intake templates (Excel tabs your SMEs can fill)

* Provide **controlled headings** + dropdowns to prevent typos.
* Example tabs & key columns:

  * **Employees:** name | role | location | availability\_start | clearance | bill\_rate\_band
  * **Skills:** employee\_name | skill | subskill | proficiency(1–5) | last\_used(YYYY-MM)
  * **Certs:** employee\_name | cert | issuer | id | expires\_on | verification\_url
  * **Projects:** title | client\_industry | summary | start\_end | tech\_stack | **metric\_name | before | after | unit | period** | reference\_name/email
  * **Capabilities:** capability | description | maturity | evidence\_link
  * **Partners:** name | capability | rate\_band | contact | nda\_on\_file
* Add a “**DataDictionary**” tab describing every column.

## 5) Ingest & parse (turn files into rows)

* **Excel/Sheets:** load via CSV readers; validate column names; capture row counts.
* **Resumes:** parse to JSON (name, roles, dates, skills, certs, projects).

  * Extract skills via a **skills ontology** (e.g., React→UI.Web.React; AWS.Cognito; Data.Kafka).
  * Normalize dates (“Apr 2023” → `2023-04`), capture **last\_used** per skill.
* **Databases:** build lightweight ETL to curated tables/views for **employees, assignments, projects, costs**.

## 6) Standardize & clean

* Apply **taxonomies**:

  * Skills: “ReactJS/React.js/React” → **React**; “SQL DW/Synapse” → **Azure Synapse**.
  * Security: “OIDC/MFA/SSO” grouped under **Identity & Access**.
* Normalize units & formats: dates (ISO), percentages, currency, durations.
* Add **synonym maps** for RFP terms (e.g., “real-time” ≈ “streaming/events”, “Cognito” ≈ “OIDC IdP”).

## 7) Entity resolution (dedupe & link)

* People: match resumes ↔ HR by email + name + hash of employment dates.
* Skills: collapse duplicates; keep highest **proficiency** and most recent **last\_used**.
* Projects: unify by title + client + dates; link contributors (ProjectEmployee).
* Keep **gold IDs** (GUIDs) for Employee, Project, Skill.

## 8) Evidence attachment (make claims provable)

* Link **metrics** to artifacts: dashboards, acceptance letters, scorecards, Credly cert badges.
* Store evidence URLs in a safe registry; validate reachability (200 OK).
* For compliance (HIPAA/PCI), attach policy doc or audit reference.

## 9) Coverage mapping to the RFP

* For each **Requirement** (e.g., *“React SPA + OIDC + MFA”*):

  * Find **Employees** with React + OIDC experience, availability within timeline.
  * Pull **Projects** showing React/Spring on AWS with secure login metrics.
  * Pull **Capabilities/Partners** (e.g., Cognito templates, Keycloak realm configs).
* Materialize a **CoverageMatrix** table: requirement\_id → covered\_by (employee/project/capability/partner) + **coverage\_level** + evidence\_ref.

## 10) Gap analysis & what-ifs

* Identify missing skills (e.g., **Kinesis Data Analytics**).
* Suggest mitigations:

  * **Partner X** adds skill; **training** plan (name, start, ETA); **hire** (role, lead time).
* Estimate impact: cost delta, schedule shift, risk rating.

## 11) Fit scoring & selection

* Compute a **FitScore** per requirement + overall:

  * Coverage (weighted by must/should), past performance similarity, availability, risk penalties.
* Select **top 3 case studies** that best match tech/domain/metrics.

## 12) Publish to the proposal template

* Output **JSON/materialized views** bound to sections:

  * **Executive summary:** RFP goals + proof points (3 metrics).
  * **Compliance matrix:** requirement → how we meet it → evidence link.
  * **Staffing plan:** names, roles, start dates, percent allocation.
  * **Architecture:** React → API → Spring → Streams (Kinesis/MSK) → S3/Glue/Redshift.
  * **Risks & mitigations:** from gap analysis.
  * **Timeline & SLAs:** derived from availability + past velocity.

## 13) Quality gates (before handoff)

* Field completeness ≥ **95%** for required columns.
* No **expired certs** shown for must-have compliance.
* Evidence links valid; **last\_used** for key skills within **18 months**.
* Duplicates < **1%**; names/email collisions resolved.
* Spot check with SMEs (React, Spring, AWS, Security, Data).

## 14) Governance, security, privacy

* Version RFP/Q\&A and every intake file (date-stamped).
* PII minimization: store only what’s required; encrypt at rest; role-based access.
* Audit trail: who changed what/when; template version used for the response.

## 15) Automate refresh (so it stays current)

* Nightly or weekly pipelines: pull HR/ATS, CRM, project metrics; recalc coverage & scores.
* Alerts on **stale data** (e.g., cert expiring in 60 days, availability slips).

---

# Source-specific “how-to” cheatsheets

## Excel / Google Sheets

* **Ask SMEs** to use provided templates; lock headers and validations.
* Enforce: `last_updated`, `owner`, **no merged cells**, one record per row.
* Store in `/intake/raw/excel/YYYY-MM-DD/…`; ETL to **bronze/silver/gold** zones.

## Resumes (PDF/DOCX)

* Keep original + parsed JSON side by side.
* Extract: roles, dates, **skills with last\_used**, certs (issuer/id/expiry), **project bullets with metrics**.
* Human-in-the-loop pass for key personnel (Principal Architect, Security Lead).

## Business Databases (HR/ATS/CRM/PMO)

* Create **read views**: `vw_employees`, `vw_assignments`, `vw_projects`, `vw_references`.
* Map fields to canonical schema; mask unnecessary PII; timestamp snapshots.

## Knowledge Stores (Confluence/Jira/Git)

* Index **architecture diagrams**, **runbooks**, **Terraform/CI templates** as **Capabilities** with evidence links.
* Tag assets with domains: UI, Auth, Streaming, Analytics, AWS.

# Example: fields the SME actually fills (tiny sample)

**Employees.xlsx (Skills tab)**

* `employee_name | skill | subskill | proficiency(1–5) | last_used(YYYY-MM)`

  * *Jane Doe | React | Routing/Auth | 5 | 2025-07*
  * *Mike Lee | Spring Boot | REST APIs | 4 | 2025-06*
  * *Tariq A. | AWS | Cognito (OIDC/MFA) | 4 | 2025-05*
  * *Nina P. | Streaming | Kafka/MSK | 4 | 2025-08*

**Projects.xlsx (Metrics section)**

* `project_title | metric_name | before | after | unit | period`

  * *Legacy → React/Spring AWS | Page load | 3.2 | 1.8 | sec | p95*
  * *Streaming orders | Alert latency | 8 | 1.7 | sec | avg*
  * *Data platform | Infra cost | — | -35% | % | monthly*

These rows are enough for the pipeline to pick **React/Spring/AWS/Auth/Streaming/Analytics** matches and auto-fill the proposal.



* **How it’s used**

  * Drives the **compliance matrix** (must/should/could) and **fit scoring** (weights from evaluation criteria).
  * Anchors **section mapping** (scope, SOW tasks, SLAs, deliverables, timelines) → ProposalOutputTemplate placeholders.
  * Flags **constraints** (budget caps, location, clearance, small-biz set-asides, certifications) to filter teams.
* **Data engineer: review & fill**

  * Normalize to a **requirements taxonomy** (e.g., domain → capability → skill → tool) with unique IDs and priority/weight.
  * Extract & structure **evaluation criteria** (criterion, weight, rubric text, pass/fail thresholds).
  * Parse timelines (due dates, contract period, milestones), buyer metadata (agency, industry), and **mandatory quals**.
  * Add **synonym maps** (e.g., “M365” ≈ “O365”; “Keycloak” ≈ “OIDC IdP”) so matching is robust.
  * Capture **attachment references** and **Q\&A addenda** with versioning.

# Employee (skills, certs, availability)

* **How it’s used**

  * Builds the **staffing plan** and **key personnel** resumes with verifiable skills/certs matched to requirements.
  * Availability windows feed **feasibility** and **ramp plans**.
* **Data engineer: review & fill**

  * Standardize to a **skills ontology** (skill → subskill → tool), include **proficiency** and **last-used** dates.
  * Structure **certifications** (issuer, level, ID, **expiry**, renewal status; “planned” with ETA).
  * Add **constraints** (location, travel %, clearance level, bill rate bands).
  * Integrate **calendar/assignment** data for capacity and soft conflicts.

# ProjectExperience (past performance & metrics)

* **How it’s used**

  * Select **most-relevant past projects** that mirror the RFP domain, KPIs, tech stack, and constraints.
  * Auto-populate **case studies** and **customer references** sections.
* **Data engineer: review & fill**

  * Normalize **success metrics** (SLA %, uptime, cycle time, cost savings) with unit/period and before/after baselines.
  * Tag projects with **industry, domain, tech stack, compliance** (HIPAA, FedRAMP, PCI, etc.).
  * Link **contributors → roles → responsibilities** for “what this team actually did.”
  * Maintain **reference contacts** (name, role, contact policy) and **evidence artifacts** (acceptance letters, scorecards).

# CompanyCapabilities (competencies & industry experience)

* **How it’s used**

  * Forms the **corporate quals**, **differentiators**, and **methodologies** mapped directly to RFP asks.
  * Backstops staffing gaps with **organizational assets** (accelerators, playbooks, labs, IP).
* **Data engineer: review & fill**

  * Map to a **capability model** (e.g., Data Eng → ELT → CDC; Security → IAM → Keycloak) with maturity levels.
  * Attach **proof points** (certs, partner tiers, audited reports, tool accreditations) and **industry experience tags**.
  * Version corporate **methodologies** (SDLC, MLOps, governance) and link to case evidence.

# SkillsGapAnalysis (gaps & what-ifs)

* **How it’s used**

  * Quantifies **coverage vs. requirement**; proposes **mitigations** (training, hires, partners, subcontractors).
  * Feeds **risk & transition** sections and **ramp plans** (who upskills by when).
* **Data engineer: review & fill**

  * Compute **coverage matrix** (RequirementID → {CoveredBy\[employee/capability/project], CoverageLevel, Evidence}).
  * Model **what-if scenarios** (add partner with skill X, train Y by date Z) and recompute fit score.
  * Maintain **partner/vendor registry** (capabilities, rates, NDAs) for gap backfill.

# ProposalOutputTemplate (templates & configuration)

* **How it’s used**

  * Defines **section→data binding** and **conditional logic** (include/exclude sections based on RFP type/industry).
  * Controls **tone/style** and **branding**; ensures repeatable, auditable generation.
* **Data engineer: review & fill**

  * Create a **schema-driven template** (placeholders + rules). Example:

    ```yaml
    sections:
      - id: exec_summary
        source: ai.summarize(RfpData.scope, CompanyCapabilities.differentiators)
      - id: compliance_matrix
        source: buildCompliance(RfpData.requirements, CoverageMatrix)
      - id: staffing_plan
        source: selectTeam(Employee, RfpData, availability_window)
        rules: [must_include:key_personnel, limit:10]
      - id: past_performance
        source: rankProjects(ProjectExperience, RfpData.criteria, top:3)
    ```
  * Add **validation hooks** (no empty placeholders, citation for every claim, date/currency formatting).

---

## Cross-Entity Relationships Needed

* **RfpData.requirements** ↔ **Skills/Capabilities**: many-to-many via `RequirementSkill{ requirement_id, skill_id, weight }`.
* **Employee** ↔ **Skills/Certifications**: many-to-many with `proficiency`, `last_used`, `cert_expiry`.
* **ProjectExperience** ↔ **Skills/Capabilities** and ↔ **Employees**: evidences who did what on which tech.
* **CompanyCapabilities** ↔ **Skills & Evidence**: capabilities proven by projects, certs, partnerships.
* **SkillsGapAnalysis** ↔ (RfpData, Employee, CompanyCapabilities, Partners): computed coverage & scenarios.
* **ProposalOutputTemplate** ↔ all above via **data bindings** and **conditional rules**.

---

## Fit Scoring & Selection Logic (to guide generation)

* **Requirement coverage (50–70%)**: Σ(weighted coverage) with penalties for unmet “musts.”
* **Evaluator criteria alignment (10–20%)**: map criteria→evidence (projects, certs, SLAs).
* **Relevance of past performance (10–20%)**: cosine/Jaccard similarity on tech/domain/metrics.
* **Availability & risk (10–15%)**: staffing feasibility, ramp time, dependency on partners.
* **Cost/price realism (optional)**: if inputs available, check against budget caps.

> `FitScore = w1*Coverage + w2*Criteria + w3*PastPerf + w4*Availability - w5*Risk`

---

## Data Engineer Quality Checklist (per area)

* **Standardization**: shared **ontologies/taxonomies** for skills, capabilities, industries, and metrics.
* **Completeness**: mandatory fields present (e.g., cert expiry, project outcomes, requirement weights).
* **Freshness**: last-updated dates; flag stale skills (>18 months unused) or expired certs.
* **Evidence links**: every claim has a **verifiable artifact** (reference letter, KPI report, badge URL).
* **Synonyms & entity resolution**: dedupe names (Azure Synapse vs. SQL DW; Keycloak vs. OIDC IdP).
* **Governance**: version RFP/Q\&A, template versions, audit trail of generated content.

---

## Minimal Logical Schema (starter)

* `RfpData(id, buyer, due_date, type[RFP|RFI], requirement_id→Requirements, criteria_id→EvalCriteria, constraints JSON)`
* `Requirements(id, text, priority[must|should|could], weight)`
* `EvalCriteria(id, name, description, weight, rubric)`
* `Skills(id, name, taxonomy_path, synonyms[])`
* `Employee(id, name, location, clearance, availability, rate_band)`
* `EmployeeSkill(employee_id, skill_id, proficiency, last_used)`
* `Certification(id, name, issuer, level, expires_on)`
* `EmployeeCertification(employee_id, cert_id, status[current|planned], eta)`
* `Project(id, title, industry, summary, metrics JSON, evidence_urls[])`
* `ProjectSkill(project_id, skill_id, role, contribution_notes)`
* `ProjectEmployee(project_id, employee_id, role)`
* `Capability(id, name, maturity, evidence_ids[])`
* `RequirementSkill(requirement_id, skill_id, weight)`
* `Partner(id, capability_ids[], rates, nda_on_file)`
* `CoverageMatrix(requirement_id, covered_by[type:employee|project|capability|partner], coverage_level, evidence_ref)`

With this structure and checklist, the AI proposal engine can: parse the RFP/RFI → map requirements to your capabilities/people → quantify coverage and risks → select optimal evidence → and render a compliant, evaluator-aligned proposal from the template—while the data engineer ensures the underlying data is standardized, complete, current, and provable.

# Example

A “data-driven proposal” **complex app-modernization**: bad legacy app → **ReactJS UI + Java Spring** services on **AWS**, **secure login**, **real-time data**, and **large-scale analytics**. 

---

# 1) What the buyer is asking (RFP example)

* **Scope (must-haves)**

  * Rebuild legacy UI in **ReactJS**; backend to **Java Spring** microservices.
  * Deploy on **AWS** with landing zone, IaC, CI/CD, and **99.9% uptime**.
  * **Secure login** (SSO/OIDC, MFA), role-based access, audit trails.
  * **Real-time data** ingestion (events/transactions) and streaming dashboards.
  * **Analytics at scale** (data lake + warehouse; governed access; cost controls).
* **Constraints**

  * Go-live in **90–120 days**; phased migration (no big bang).
  * Data residency (US), encryption at rest/in transit, compliance (e.g., HIPAA/PCI as applicable).
* **How they’ll score**

  * Technical approach **30%** | Team quals **25%** | Past performance **25%** | Risk/transition **10%** | Price **10%**

---

# 2) How each dataset powers the winning story

## RfpData (requirements & scoring)

* **Use:** Turns the RFP into a checklist and weights the pitch.
* **Business mapping:**

  * “React front end” → show a **component library** and UX migration plan.
  * “Spring microservices” → show **domain decomposition** + API standards.
  * “Secure login” → show **OIDC/MFA** (AWS Cognito or Keycloak) + audit logging.
  * “Real-time” → show **Kinesis/MSK (Kafka)** + streaming processors + dashboards.
  * “Analytics” → show **S3 data lake + Glue/Athena or Redshift**; governed data access.
* **Outputs for proposal:** A **compliance matrix** tying every must-have to an implementation detail and proof.

## Employee (who, with what certs, and when)

* **Use:** Assembles a credible delivery team with availability that matches the timeline.
* **Roles (example):**

  * **React Lead**, **Spring Lead**, **AWS Cloud Architect**, **DevOps/SRE**,
    **Security Architect (SSO/zero trust)**, **Data Engineer (streaming)**, **Analytics Lead**.
* **Exec view:** “We can start in 2 weeks; 7 named people allocated 60–100% through go-live.”

## ProjectExperience (proof we’ve done this)

* **Use:** Picks 2–3 case studies that mirror this exact job.
* **Examples:**

  * **“Retail platform”**: monolith → React/Spring on AWS; **12-week MVP**, **40% page-load improvement**, **35% infra cost down** via autoscaling.
  * **“Healthcare analytics”**: streaming vitals to S3 + Redshift; **HIPAA controls**, **<2s alert latency**, executive dashboards.
* **Exec view:** Concrete metrics + references the evaluator can call.

## CompanyCapabilities (your muscle)

* **Use:** Shows accelerators and repeatable methods that reduce risk/time.
* **Examples:**

  * React design system, Spring scaffolding, AWS landing-zone templates, **CICD pipeline blueprints**, **FinOps cost dashboards**, data governance playbooks.
* **Exec view:** “We don’t start from scratch; we start from assets.”

## SkillsGapAnalysis (honest plan for gaps)

* **Use:** Quantifies where we’re thin and the mitigation.
* **Examples:**

  * “Limited **Kinesis Data Analytics** expertise internally → bring Partner X; knowledge transfer by Week 6.”
  * “Need 24×7 support from go-live → ramp SRE runbooks + on-call schedule.”
* **Exec view:** Transparent risk with dates, owners, and budget impact.

## ProposalOutputTemplate (your franchise recipe)

* **Use:** Auto-fills sections so nothing is missed and tone is consistent.
* **Sections auto-filled:** Executive Summary, Compliance Matrix, Team, Architecture, Migration Plan, Security, SRE & SLAs, Data & Analytics, Risks/Mitigations, Timeline, Assumptions.

---

# 3) How the data connects (simple relationships)

* **Every RFP requirement** links to **people + capabilities + proof**

  * *“Secure login”* → (Security Architect + SSO capability + past HIPAA project)
  * *“Real-time events”* → (Data Engineer + Kinesis/ Kafka assets + retail streaming case study)
* **Availability** ↔ **timeline** so we only commit to what we can staff.
* **Case studies** ↔ **scoring criteria** (if past performance is 25%, we surface outcomes and references first).

---

# 4) What the generated proposal actually says (snippet)

* **Executive Summary (1 page):**
  “In 16 weeks, we’ll replace the legacy UI with **React**, move the backend to **Spring microservices**, and deploy to **AWS** with secure SSO and real-time insights. We reuse our **landing-zone templates** and **component library** to cut risk and time. You get **<2s streaming dashboards**, governed analytics on S3/Redshift, and **99.9% uptime** supported by on-call SREs.”
* **Compliance Matrix (excerpt):**

  * React SPA with routing & auth → ✅ React + OIDC SDK, role-based views
  * Spring microservices + APIs → ✅ Spring Boot, OpenAPI, rate-limit, circuit-breakers
  * SSO/MFA → ✅ AWS Cognito (or Keycloak), MFA enforced, audit logs to CloudWatch/SIEM
  * Real-time streaming → ✅ Kinesis streams + Flink or MSK + Kafka Streams
  * Analytics at scale → ✅ S3 data lake + Glue catalogs + Athena/Redshift; columnar formats
  * IaC / CI-CD → ✅ Terraform + GitHub Actions; blue/green deploy; automated tests
* **Architecture (high-level):**
  React SPA → API Gateway/ALB → Spring services (EKS/ECS) → Streams (Kinesis/Kafka) →
  S3 Data Lake → Glue/Athena/Redshift → BI (QuickSight/Power BI)
  Identity: Cognito/Keycloak + OIDC → fine-grained roles; Logs/metrics to CloudWatch + OpenSearch.
* **Migration plan (strangler pattern):**
  Phase 1: carve out auth + a priority feature → Phase 2: core services + streaming → Phase 3: analytics & decommission legacy.
* **SLAs/KPIs:**
  Uptime **99.9%**, p95 API **<300ms**, streaming **<2s end-to-dash**, error budget **1%**, daily cost trend visible (FinOps).

---

# 5) What the data team must keep tidy for this bid

* **RfpData:** All must/should/could tagged; deadlines, security/compliance flags, environment constraints.
* **Employee:** Named roles with **skills, certs, and availability dates** (e.g., AWS Pro, React, Spring, Kafka; HIPAA familiarity).
* **ProjectExperience:** Metrics with **before/after** and a **contactable reference**.
* **Capabilities:** Reusable assets (React library, Terraform modules, CI/CD templates), partner letters, compliance artifacts.
* **SkillsGapAnalysis:** Clear “who/what/when” mitigations (partner, training, hire).
* **Template:** Auto-bindings to prevent empty sections; every claim cites a person, asset, or case study.

---

# 6) Quick “fit score” example (for exec review)

* **Coverage of must-haves (55%)**: 52/55 (only Kinesis analytics via partner)
* **Past performance (20%)**: 18/20 (two highly similar projects)
* **Team availability (15%)**: 13/15 (two roles partial until Week 3)
* **Risk/transition (10%)**: 9/10 (clear phased plan, partner in place)
* **Total:** **92/100** → **Green**

---

# 7) Risks & mitigations (honest + credible)

* **Vendor lock-in / cost drift** → FinOps guardrails, autoscaling policies, savings plan review at Week 8.
* **Data quality for analytics** → Contract “gold” schemas; PII masking; data tests in CI.
* **Auth complexity** → Start with a small secure perimeter (login + RBAC), expand; pen test pre-go-live.
* **Legacy cutover** → Canary releases + feature flags; rollbacks tested in lower envs.

---

# 8) Timeline (example, 16 weeks)

* **Weeks 1–2:** Discovery, domain decomposition, landing zone, identity integration.
* **Weeks 3–6:** React shell + first Spring services; CI/CD; initial streaming path.
* **Weeks 7–10:** Expand services; real-time dashboards; data lake scaffolding.
* **Weeks 11–14:** Analytics models; performance, security, DR tests; canary releases.
* **Weeks 15–16:** UAT, training, handover; legacy decommission plan.

---

**Bottom line for you:** our **data** makes the proposal airtight—every requirement maps to named people, reusable assets, and past results, with a clear plan for gaps. That’s how we promise **faster time-to-value** and **lower risk** while modernizing to **React + Spring on AWS** with **secure SSO, real-time data**, and **enterprise analytics**.
